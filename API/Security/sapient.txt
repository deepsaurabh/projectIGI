Guys, did anyone of you hear/know what Sapient did recently?

See what happened…

1. You reach your office at 9:00 in the morning;
2. Being called in for a meeting with the director;
3. Told that SAPIENT is RESTRUCTURING itself;
4. So needs to kick your sorry ass out;
5. As you were on bench for 1 month;
6. Doesn’t matter if you were actually being assigned a new project by the end of the week itself;
7. Doesn’t matter if your project manager does not acually know anything about what firing session is actually about to start;
8. You are in tears and shock after the news;
9. You are NOT ALLOWED to return to your desks after the news is broken to you;
10. YOU ARE ESCORTED VIA THE BACK DOOR TO THE COMPANY GATE, as if you had lost your way in and the company needs to make sure so one sees you on the way out. All you PERSONAL STUFF is lying outside the gate when you reach there while escorted;
11. You are given a month’s time of sitting at you home and told to never report during that time.
12. Your peers lucky to be still inside are being given direct warnings telling the “YOU ARE NEXT”!!
13. Your CEO channels a mail nationwide Sapient, justifying the action taken, backing it up with the positive changes in the offing…
14. You get your letters etc delivered @ home, being printed and delivered by an outsourced firm specializing in carrying out this ‘DIRTY WORK';
15. You are still jobless wondering what the hell went wrong with your work and job;
16. You are insecure, hopeless, and apprehensive about tomorrow…

And the SAPIENT towers stand tall and are still going strong with the axe, cutting all roots, and employees who don’t matter anymore …

Freshers just out of college, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years XP holders.. it just doesn’t matter…

So SAPIENT, why are you not in the list above?
